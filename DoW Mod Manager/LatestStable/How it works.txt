Let's say you builded a new version of DoW Mod Manager and this new version is 1.9.9
To enable autoupdates you will have to:
* Copy your new executable in this directory (LatestStable)
* Rename it to "DoW Mod Manager.exe" (without any version number in name!)
* Edit file "version" so it will contain a version number (in format X.X.X)
* Commit changes and upload it on GitHub
