## Version 2.0.4:

- Optimization: added ability to use AOT compiler - the fastest way to execute .NET application! 557 ms and 9788 Kb of RAM (default singlethreaded JIT compilation) vs 432 ms and 9876 Kb of RAM (Multithreaded JIT compilation) vs 363 ms and 6316 Kb of RAM (AOT compilation)

## Version 1.6.1:

- Improved the usability of the Mod Merger.
- Changed the Mod Merger dropdown list not to accept user text input anymore but be a pure dropdown list now.
- Selection of Mod Merger items is now only one per time, to make it less confusing which element is currently active.

## Version 1.6.0:

First of all - application versions will be a little more consistent now:
1. First value is a major version.
2. Second value is a feature version.
3. Third value is a bugfix version.

So 1.6.0 means "major version 1, feature version 6, bugfix version 0"

Here are the changes for version 1.6.0:

- Added support for mods for Winter Assault and Original. Gold Edition is also supported but if you want to play with mods for Original - you have to temporary rename your Winter Assault executable. That could be simplified in future releases
- Added new Advanced Start Option - "/high /affinity 6". It sets priority to "High" and forces game to use only threads 2 and 3 for performance reasons.
- A lot of code refactoring. That will help to maintain a healthy and readable code for any future contributors ;-)
