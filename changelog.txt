- Some code improvements

## Version 1.6.1:

- Improved the usability of the Mod Merger.
- Changed the Mod Merger dropdown list not to accept user text input anymore but be a pure dropdown list now.
- Selection of Mod Merger items is now only one per time, to make it less confusing which element is currently active.

## Version 1.6.0:

First of all - application versions will be a little more consistent now:
1. First value is a major version.
2. Second value is a feature version.
3. Third value is a bugfix version.

So 1.6.0 means "major version 1, feature version 6, bugfix version 0"

Here are the changes for version 1.6.0:

- Added support for mods for Winter Assault and Original. Gold Edition is also supported but if you want to play with mods for Original - you have to temporary rename your Winter Assault executable. That could be simplified in future releases
- Added new Advanced Start Option - "/high /affinity 6". It sets priority to "High" and forces game to use only threads 2 and 3 for performance reasons.
- A lot of code refactoring. That will help to maintain a healthy and readable code for any future contributors ;-)
- DoW Mod Manager frame name now changes automatically according to Assembly Name
