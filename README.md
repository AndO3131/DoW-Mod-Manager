# DoW-Mod-Manager-1.3
The initial push for the DoW Mod Manager files. It's made with the Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition.

This version is supposed to add a Mod Merger functionality. So you can easily combine Race Mods together into one Mod
that can be easily loaded, via the Mod Manager too.

The Mod merger will be a seperate window that pops-up upon pressing a button, allowing you to add and remove mods from your
mod loadout, as well as activating/disabling them. Changing the Loadorder of the Mods will also be possible.
